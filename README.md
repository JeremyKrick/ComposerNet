Deep Learning for Accurate Composer Identification in Music

The proposed project aims to develop a sophisticated deep learning system capable of accurately predicting the composer of a given musical score. By leveraging two deep learning techniques: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the project seeks to revolutionize composer identification in the realm of classical music.


The project will utilize a comprehensive dataset consisting of MIDI files and sheet music encompassing compositions from renowned classical composers, including Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Schubert, among others. Each score in the dataset is labeled with the name of its respective composer.
